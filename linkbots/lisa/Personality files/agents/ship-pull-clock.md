# Ship / Pull Clock — Lisa Option A

**Doctrine SOT:** IDE Development `docs/AUTONOMOUS-GIT-OPERATIONS.md` (ADR 0003 amendment 2026-07-25; Ship 05 / Pull 07 as of 2026-07-25).  
**Primary clock:** This procedure. Cursor Automations are **optional backup only** — do not treat them as the studio clock.

**Wave names** use **local hour** labels (Asia/Taipei): Ship 05, Pull 07, Ship 16, Pull 18 — not A/B letters and not `Ship 05:00`.

## Hard prerequisites (ops)

- **Mac Mini must be awake** (Keep Awake / Remote Control) so Cursor ACP can spawn.
- Lisa gateway running with profile `lisa`; ACP/`acpx` healthy.
- Do **not** put secrets, tokens, or Keychain material in this repo or in cron message text.
- Isolated cron jobs **must not** call `cron.add` / `cron.update` / `cron.remove` for other jobs.

## Calendar (Asia/Taipei)

| Job name       | Cron expr (tz Asia/Taipei) | Wave    |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------- |
| `lisa-ship-05` | `0 5 * * *`                | Ship 05 |
| `lisa-pull-07` | `0 7 * * *`                | Pull 07 |
| `lisa-ship-16` | `0 16 * * *`               | Ship 16 |
| `lisa-pull-18` | `0 18 * * *`               | Pull 18 |

Morning Ship moved earlier (05:00) and Pull to 07:00 so the **08:30 morning digest** can cover all four daily waves (prior evening Ship 16 + Pull 18, plus morning Ship 05 + Pull 07) before Review #1.

Each job: isolated `agentTurn`, preferred `agentId: lisa-cron` (same pattern as `lisa-morning-digest` / `lisa-heartbeat-45`). Announce → Telegram `1123023078` with the **one-line** Clear/Issues result only (no lists/links). **Also** email that same one line (see below).

**Tool allowlist:** cron `payload.toolsAllow` **and** `agents.list[lisa-cron].tools.allow` must both include `sessions_spawn` and `sessions_yield`. OpenClaw intersects them — listing the tool only on the job is not enough (Ship 16 2026-07-25: job had `sessions_spawn`, agent allowlist did not → tool missing at runtime). See `linkbots/lisa/docs/SHIP-PULL-CLOCK-INSTALL.md`. Ship/pull jobs that send email also need `exec` (or equivalent) so `tools/bin/lisa-safe email-send` can run — match digest allowlisting practice.

## Repo list (sequential — one at a time)

Process **exactly one repo at a time**, in this order, skipping any path that is missing on disk:

1. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/IDE Development`
2. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/openclaw_prime`
3. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKplatform`
4. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKskills`
5. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKbrain`
6. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKsites`
7. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKdeveloper`
8. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKlibraries`
9. `/Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKautowork`

Do not parallelize. Unfinished Ship/Pull work on a later repo is fine — roll forward next wave.

## Status file

Write/update:

`/Users/linktrend/.openclaw-lisa/workspace/memory/pipeline-status.md`

Keep a `Cycle date: YYYY-MM-DD` metadata line plus one result line per known checkpoint in that Asia/Taipei morning-digest cycle: prior-evening Ship 16 + Pull 18, then current-morning Ship 05 + Pull 07. Derive the expected cycle from the cron run's nominal scheduled occurrence, not its completion time: the next calendar date for Ship 16/Pull 18 and the same date for Ship 05/Pull 07. Compare it with the stored cycle date before writing. If no date is stored or the expected date is newer, remove all four old Ship/Pull result lines, store the expected date, and write the current wave. If dates match, replace only the current wave line. If the expected date is older, the run is delayed or retried from a prior cycle: do not change the status file or erase the newer results. This monotonic rule also makes any current wave that resumes after a missed Ship 16 discard stale results. Preserve recognized Staging/Main lines until their owning checkpoint updates them. Mirror shapes and freshness rules in `agents/pipeline-status.md`. Prefer also keeping the personality-mirror copy in sync when editing in-repo: `memory/pipeline-status.md`.

## Cron run procedure (Lisa)

When a ship/pull cron fires:

### Silent work (mandatory)

Emit **no** mid-run assistant text (“Starting WAVE…”, “processing repos…”, “Writing the status line…”). Tool calls only until the final reply. The announced Telegram body must be **exactly one line** (`WAVE: Clear` or `WAVE: Issues`) — nothing else (2026-07-26 Pull: narration leaked into announce). **Plain Telegram text only** — never wrap that one-liner in Markdown code fences.

1. `read` this file (`agents/ship-pull-clock.md`).
2. Spawn **one** Cursor ACP session with `sessions_spawn`:
   - `runtime: "acp"`
   - `agentId: "cursor"`
   - `model: "grok-4.5[effort=high,fast=true]"`
   - `task`: the matching **Shipper** or **Puller** prompt below (fill WAVE label).
3. Wait for ACP completion (or fail). Do **not** substitute a Lisa subagent or self-write code.
4. On spawn failure: leave the exact error in the cron run trace, update the status file with `WAVE: Issues` using the cycle-preserving rules above, send the email side effect, then return only the Telegram one-liner; stop. Never put the error in the final Telegram reply.
5. On success: accept only Cursor's exact `WAVE: Clear` or `WAVE: Issues` reply, then have Lisa write that result to the status file using the monotonic cycle-date rules above. Cursor does not own or edit this shared status file.
6. **Email (required side-effect, separate from heartbeat):** write the same one line to `scratch/pipeline_status_email.txt`, then run **exactly one** unpiped `exec` (no pipes, no `ls`, no multi-step plans):
   ```bash
   tools/bin/lisa-safe email-send --to calusa@linktrend.media --subject "<WAVE> status" --body-file scratch/pipeline_status_email.txt
   ```
   Subject examples: `Ship 05 status`, `Pull 07 status`. Body is exactly one line (`WAVE: Clear` or `WAVE: Issues`) — no lists, no links, no Battery content. Send for **both** Clear and Issues after the wave finishes across the repo list. If email fails once, **keep Telegram delivery** and finish with the one-line status — do not abort the cron or invent Clear/Issues from an email failure alone.
7. **Telegram:** only after the email attempt, return the final cron reply as **only** that one line (Clear or Issues). This final assistant reply is what cron announces.

### HARD RULES — `lisa-safe` (Pull 07 2026-07-26 failure)

`tools/bin/lisa-safe` is a **script file**, not a directory.

1. **Never** `ls` / list / explore / “list files in” `tools/bin/lisa-safe` or `~/.openclaw-lisa/workspace/tools/bin/lisa-safe`.
2. **Never** multi-step exec plans such as `list files in … → print text → print text`.
3. **Do not** probe or verify the binary before use. Invoke `email-send` directly once, exactly as above.
4. Order: ACP spawn → status file → email attempt → final Telegram one-liner. Do not start the run by exploring `tools/bin`.

## ACP prompt — Shipper

Replace `WAVE` with `Ship 05` or `Ship 16`.

```text
WAVE (Asia/Taipei). You are the Implementer shipper under IDE Development autonomous Git ops (Lisa Option A clock).

Process ONE REPO AT A TIME in this exact order (skip missing paths):
1) /Users/linktrend/Projects/IDE Development
2) /Users/linktrend/Projects/openclaw_prime
3) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKplatform
4) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKskills
5) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKbrain
6) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKsites
7) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKdeveloper
8) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKlibraries
9) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKautowork

For each repo that has local changes or unpushed commits on a work branch (prefer issue/*; also cursor/*, rare dev/*):
1) Commit with conventional commits if there are changes (never commit secrets).
2) Push the branch.
3) Open or update a PR targeting development.
4) STOP. Do not merge. Do not self-review. Do not touch staging/main. Bugbot reviews; Integrator merges.

Do not edit /Users/linktrend/.openclaw-lisa/workspace/memory/pipeline-status.md; Lisa owns the shared status writer and cycle-date checks.

Reply with exactly one line only: `WAVE: Clear` or `WAVE: Issues`.
```

## ACP prompt — Puller

Replace `WAVE` with `Pull 07` or `Pull 18`.

```text
WAVE (Asia/Taipei). You are the Implementer puller under IDE Development autonomous Git ops (Lisa Option A clock).

Pull is NOT hard-gated on all PRs being merged. Unfinished work rolls forward.

Process ONE REPO AT A TIME in this exact order (skip missing paths):
1) /Users/linktrend/Projects/IDE Development
2) /Users/linktrend/Projects/openclaw_prime
3) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKplatform
4) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKskills
5) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKbrain
6) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKsites
7) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKdeveloper
8) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKlibraries
9) /Users/linktrend/Projects/LiNKautowork

For each repo with a checked-out work branch (issue/*, cursor/*, rare dev/*) — not development/staging/main as the place to dump work:
1) git fetch origin
2) Merge origin/development into the current work branch (unless the repo already mandates rebase).
3) Do not invent merges into staging/main.
4) Note blockers privately; do not paste lists into the status line.

Do not edit /Users/linktrend/.openclaw-lisa/workspace/memory/pipeline-status.md; Lisa owns the shared status writer and cycle-date checks.

Reply with exactly one line only: `WAVE: Clear` or `WAVE: Issues`.
```

## Install / repair cron jobs (main session or operator — not from isolated cron)

Use gateway CLI (unpiped). Example pattern (adjust flags to match live `cron --help` / existing digest jobs):

```bash
PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH" \
node /Users/linktrend/Projects/openclaw_prime/openclaw.mjs --profile lisa cron list
```

Create four jobs named `lisa-ship-05`, `lisa-pull-07`, `lisa-ship-16`, `lisa-pull-18` with the exprs above, isolated session, `agentId: lisa-cron`, announce → Telegram `1123023078`, message pointing at this procedure (e.g. “Run agents/ship-pull-clock.md for Ship 05”). Prefer matching flags used by `lisa-morning-digest`.

After install, verify with `cron list` that all four are enabled. Do not disable digest/heartbeat jobs.
