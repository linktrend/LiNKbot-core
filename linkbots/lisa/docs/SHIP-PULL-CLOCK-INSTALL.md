# Lisa Option A — Ship/Pull Cron Install Notes

**Doctrine:** IDE Development `docs/AUTONOMOUS-GIT-OPERATIONS.md`  
**Procedure:** `linkbots/lisa/Personality files/agents/ship-pull-clock.md`  
**Do not commit secrets.** Live cron state lives on the Lisa gateway (Mini), not as secrets in git.

**Wave names** use local hour labels: Ship 06, Pull 08, Ship 16, Pull 18 (not A/B letters; not `Ship 06:00`).

## Human / ops prerequisites

1. **Mac Mini awake** with Keep Awake / Remote Control so Cursor ACP can spawn at 06:00 / 08:00 / 16:00 / 18:00 Asia/Taipei.
2. Lisa gateway healthy (`--profile lisa`); ACP/`acpx` working.
3. Personality mirror deployed or live workspace has `agents/ship-pull-clock.md`.

## Existing-install migration (required)

Do not create a second set of jobs when the legacy names (`lisa-ship-a`, `lisa-pull-a`, `lisa-ship-b`, `lisa-pull-b`) already exist. Live cron jobs have stable IDs independent of their names, so migrate each existing job in place:

1. Run `cron list --json` and identify the four existing Ship/Pull job IDs by name, schedule, and payload.
2. Use `cron edit <job-id>` to update its `--name`, `--cron`, `--tz Asia/Taipei`, description, and message to the matching row below. Preserve its agent, isolated session, delivery target, and tool allowlist unless this guide explicitly changes them.
3. If both a legacy and replacement job exist for the same wave, keep them disabled until you choose the canonical job; then enable exactly one and remove the duplicate only after verifying its ID and configuration.
4. Re-run `cron list --json`. The old names must be absent, and exactly one enabled job must exist for each wave schedule before the migration is complete.

## Jobs to create (new installs only)

| Name           | Expr (Asia/Taipei) | Wave    |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| `lisa-ship-06` | `0 6 * * *`        | Ship 06 |
| `lisa-pull-08` | `0 8 * * *`        | Pull 08 |
| `lisa-ship-16` | `0 16 * * *`       | Ship 16 |
| `lisa-pull-18` | `0 18 * * *`       | Pull 18 |

Match flags used by existing `lisa-morning-digest` / `lisa-heartbeat-45`: isolated session, `agentId: lisa-cron`, announce → Telegram `1123023078`. Message body should instruct: read and run `agents/ship-pull-clock.md` for that wave (spawn Cursor ACP with the shipper or puller prompt).

### Tool allowlist (required — 2026-07-25 fix)

Ship/Pull jobs already set `payload.toolsAllow` including `sessions_spawn`. That is **not enough** alone: OpenClaw intersects cron `toolsAllow` with `agents.list[lisa-cron].tools.allow`. If `sessions_spawn` is missing from the agent allowlist, the live cron run will not expose the tool (Ship 16 2026-07-25 failed this way even though the job JSON listed it).

1. **Agent config** (`~/.openclaw-lisa/openclaw.json` → `agents.list` id `lisa-cron` → `tools.allow`) must include at least:
   - `sessions_spawn` (Cursor ACP spawn)
   - `sessions_yield` (wait for ACP completion announce)
   - plus the usual host ops tools (`read` / `write` / `edit` / `exec` / `process` / `cron` / session list helpers)
2. **Each Ship/Pull job** `payload.toolsAllow` must also include `sessions_spawn` and `sessions_yield` (digest/heartbeat jobs should **omit** these so they stay non-spawning).
3. Do **not** change `main` agent tools for this fix.

Repo SOT mirror: `linkbots/lisa/Personality files/openclaw.json`.

## Verify

```bash
PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@24/bin:$PATH" \
node /Users/linktrend/Projects/openclaw_prime/openclaw.mjs --profile lisa cron list
```

Confirm all four jobs are present and enabled (`lisa-ship-06`, `lisa-pull-08`, `lisa-ship-16`, `lisa-pull-18`). Do not disable digest/heartbeat jobs while installing.

Policy check (no Telegram): confirm live `lisa-cron.tools.allow` contains `sessions_spawn`, and each Ship/Pull job’s `toolsAllow` does too (`cron list --json`). Prefer a one-word tool-inventory agent turn over force-running Ship/Pull (force-run announces Clear/Issues to Telegram).

## Backup

If Lisa ACP is down, optional Cursor Automations remain documented in IDE Development `docs/CURSOR-AUTOMATIONS-SETUP.md` (backup only — not primary).
