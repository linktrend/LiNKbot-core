## Ownership Scope

- Files or components expected to inspect: Lisa cron/logs, HEARTBEAT/morning-digest templates, failure-signal cron classifier
- Files or components expected to modify: linkbots/lisa Personality files; src/agents/embedded-agent-runner/failure-signal.ts (+ tests); live ~/.openclaw-lisa workspace + cron payloads; dist failure-signal patch pending full rebuild
- Runtime, service, profile, or deployment scope: profile lisa, LaunchAgent ai.openclaw.lisa, port 18790
- Explicitly excluded: unrelated product repos; Keychain/security commands

## Coordination

- Parent or matching Orchestrator: cursor-local-mac-mini-desktop-workspace-orchestrator
- Related sessions: cursor-local-mac-mini-lisa-telegram-silence-20260726-0915
- Overlap risk: low after digest force-run completed
- Pre-existing changes to preserve: branch issue/ocp-lisa-digest-830-ship05 prior work
- Relayed or directly verified: live logs + SQLite cron state + Telegram messageIds 697/699

## Progress

- 10:36 — Investigated midnight→10:32 Telegram timeline; heartbeats continued; silence after 08:30 digest failure alert.
- Root cause 1: MiniMax appended `2>&1` to `lisa-safe gmail-triage` → denylist_unanalyzable hard-deny → cron announced Exec failed instead of digest.
- Root cause 2: Output templates lived inside ```text fences; model sometimes copied fences → Telegram gray “Text” code card vs plain bubble.
- Note: `7. Checks: No` means all clear (inverted Yes/No), not a failed check.
- Implemented personality plain-Telegram + no-`2>&1` rules; cron payload HARD EXEC suffix; failure-signal ignores recoverable opaque denylist denials; patched live dist + restarted gateway.
- 10:45 heartbeat delivered (messageId=697). Catch-up digest delivered ok (messageId=699), consecutiveErrors=0.
- 2026-07-27 13:45 Orchestrator correction: whole-branch safety review rejected the source-level suppression of unrecovered execution denials. PR #34 now keeps the existing fatal behavior and uses the personality-level exact-command retry rule. The historical live patch remains recorded here and will be overwritten by a full build from merged safe source before Lisa's final restart and health check.

## Next Action

- Exact next action: Orchestrator may refresh docs/current-status.md; optional full `pnpm build` so dist hashes stay consistent; Carlos can confirm Telegram digest is plain text (not code card).
- Owner: Orchestrator / Carlos
- Questions for Carlos: Did messageId=699 arrive as a normal Morning Digest bubble (not Exec failed / not gray Text card)?
- Questions for the Orchestrator or next agent: Commit personality + failure-signal changes on branch when ready; prefer full build before next gateway restart if touching other dist chunks.
